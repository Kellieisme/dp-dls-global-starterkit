# Intro

## Features

- Configuration per **environment**
  - `development` - [`sourcemaps`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/), [`browser synced developmentment server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
  - `production` - [`minification`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/terser-webpack-plugin/), [`sourcemaps`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
- Configurable **browsers versions support**. It uses [`browserslist`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list) - just specify the browsers you want to support in the `package.json` file for `browserslist`:

```js
"browserslist": [
    "last 2 versions",
    "> 5%"
]
```

- The built CSS / JavaScript files will respect the **configured supported browser versions** using the following tools:
  - [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules
  - [`babel-preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) - smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (_and optionally, browser polyfills_) are needed by your target environment(s).
- Support for **assets optimization** for production environment with ability to configure:
  - **Code Minification** of _JavaScript_ and _CSS_ processed files.
  - **Optimize Assets Loading** - inline and embed **images** / **fonts** files having file size below a _configurable_ threshold value.
  - **Image Optimization** - optimize `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `gif`, `svg` filesize and loading type via [`imagemin`](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin). Plugin and Loader for webpack to optimize (_compress_) all images using `imagemin`. Do not worry about size of images, now they are always optimized/compressed.
- Support for **source code syntax style and formatting linters** that analyze source code to flag any programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors or suspicious constructs:
  - **SASS/PostCSS syntax checker** - you can change or add additional rules in `.sasslintrc` file. Configuration options can be found on [`sass-lint`](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/blob/master/lib/config/sass-lint.yml) documentation.
  - **JavaScript syntax checker** - following the `airbnb` style, you can review and configure the rules in `.eslintrc` file. Configuration options can be found on [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) documentation.
- Latest [Webpack 5](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - _JavaScript_ module bundler.
- Latest [SASS/PostCSS](https://github.com/sass/sass) compiler based on Dart `sass`.
- Latest [Babel 7](https://github.com/babel/babel) (`@babel/core`) - JavaScript compiler - _Use next generation JavaScript, today._
- Configured and ready to use **Webpack Dev Server** plugin for faster local development - [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
- Integration with [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) - _Visualize size of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap._

## Requirements

- `node` : `>=18.12.0`
- `npm`

# Setup

## Create an .npmrc

Public NPM packages will be installed from the private NPM packages (`@jeppesen-foreflight/dls-global-assets`) will be downloaded from the Boeing Github package registry. To enable this, create a new filed named `.npmrc` in the project root. The content should be:

```
@jeppesen-foreflight:registry=https://git.web.boeing.com/api/v4/packages/npm/
//git.web.boeing.com/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Replace the folowing values:
- GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN: Create a [Github Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with all permissions. Save in a safe place. Use that string as the GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install all dependencies using `npm` _install_ command.

```sh
$ npm install
```

> If npm install fails because it can't connect to Artifactory, it may help to first run `npm config set strict-ssl false`

# Configuration

## Environment Configuration

- Edit the [`configuration/environment.js`](configuration/environment.js) if you want to specify:
  - **`server`**: configure development server, specify `host`, `port`. Refer to the full development server configuration options for [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
  - **`limits`**: configure file size thresholds for assets optimizations.
    - Image/Font files size in bytes. Below this value the image file will be served as Data URL (_inline base64_).
  - **`paths`**: `src` or `dist` directories names and file system location.

# Development

## Assets Source

- **SASS/PostCSS** files are located under `src/scss/`
- **JavaScript** files with support of latest ECMAScript _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)/ etc_ files are located under `src/js/`
- **Image** files are located under `src/images/`
- **Font** files are located under `src/fonts/`
- **HTML** files are located under `src/`
  - It will **automatically** build **all HTML files** placed under `src/` directory.

## Build Assets

### Run the token service

Before building for the first time, run the token service according to the [documentation](https://github.com/dasdigitalplatform/dls-global-assets/blob/main/token-service/README.md):

The token service will build an copy a set of required generated SCSS, CSS, JS, and JSON files to the project `/src` folder.

- `src/css/variables.css`
- `src/scss/_variables.scss`
- `src/js/variables.js`
- `src/js/variables.module.js`
- `src/json/variables.json`

### Build assets for development

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Start a development server

```sh
$ npm run start
```

# Production

## Build Assets

Optimize assets for production by:

```sh
$ npm run release
```

## Get Built Assets

- _CSS_ files are located under `/dist/css/`
- _JavaScript_ files with support of _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)_ files are located under `/dist/js/`
- _Images_ are located under `/dist/images/`
  - Images part of the _design_ (_usually referenced in the CSS_) are located under `/dist/images/design/`
  - Images part of the _content_ (_usually referenced via `<img>` tags_) are located under `/dist/images/content/`
  - Icons (_usually referenced via `<svg>` tags with a CSS class_) are located under `/dist/images/icons/`

- _Fonts_ are located under `/dist/fonts/`
- _HTML_ files are located under `/dist/`

# Run Code Style Linters

## SASS

```sh
$ npm run lint:sass
```

## JavaScript

```sh
$ npm run lint:js
```

# Additional Tools

## Run Assets Bundle Analyzer

```sh
$ npm run stats
```

> This will open the visualisation on the default configuraiton URL `localhost:8888`, you can change this URL or port following the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer#options-for-cli) documentation.
